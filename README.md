The Dungeon Game is a game I made while going through the "Beginner Python" track on Treehouse.com. It's my first project in python!

The game drops you – Player 1 – into a random position in a labyrinth. Your mission is to find the Escape door (hidden) without running into the Monster (also hidden). You can only move to an adjacent position (cardinally or diagonally) in a single move. The game will alert you if you are within 1 space of the Monster. Good luck!# dungeon-game
